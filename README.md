Functionality of the Code:

 1) Connecting to Wi-Fi:

     - It uses the SSID (network name) and password to connect to a specified Wi-Fi network.
     - Once connected, the user can access the control interface via a web browser using the IP address assigned to the ESP8266 module.

 2) User Interface (HTML + CSS + JavaScript):

     - A web page is served with buttons to control the car or device:
         - ▲ (Forward): Moves the car forward.
         - ▼ (Backward): Moves the car backward.
         - ◀ (Left): Turns the car left.
         - ▶ (Right): Turns the car right.
         - Start/Stop: A button to start or stop the car.
     - A slider to control the car's speed.
     - Two additional buttons (Function 1 and Function 2).

 3) Sending and Receiving Commands:

     - It relies on the HTTP protocol. Commands are sent from the web interface to the ESP8266 module when buttons are clicked.
     - Each command triggers a specific function in the code, displays the corresponding message on the serial monitor, and sends a response back to the browser.

 4) Core Commands:

     - /forward: Moves the car forward.
     - /backward: Moves the car backward.
     - /left: Turns the car left.
     - /right: Turns the car right.
     - /start: Starts the car.
     - /stop: Stops the car.
     - /setSpeed: Adjusts the car's speed based on the slider value.

 5) Additional Features:

     - Two extra buttons for custom functionalities:
         - Function 1: Sends "Function 1 Activated" to the serial monitor.
         - Function 2: Sends "Function 2 Activated" to the serial monitor.
